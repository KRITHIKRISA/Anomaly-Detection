# Anomaly-Detection
The goal is to detect potentially fraudulent transactions by classifying transactions as either normal or anomalous.
Anomaly â€“ something that deviates from what is standard, normal or expected
By its nature, fraud is an anomaly.
As such, fraud should be identifiable as distinctly separate from normal transactional data.
